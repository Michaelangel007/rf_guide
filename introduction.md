# 1. Introduction

Tired of _Path of Exile_ giving you Carpal Tunnel?  Want a relaxed "one button" (\*) walking simulator build?  Then Righteous Fire may be for you!

\* Technically 3 other buttons are used but they are optional: 

* Frost Blink / Leap Slam / Phase Run
* Flammability, and
* Fire Trap.

## Overview

The 3 step plan to profit is:

1. Have a crazy high amount of Life Regeneration and cast **Righteous Fire** (RF) when we enter a zone,
2. Walk into mobs and watch them (slowly) die,
3. Profit!

### Pros

* Only need to press 1 button at the start of every zone
* Tank all bosses in the campaign
* Perfect for learning Hardcore
* Not gear dependent until (mid) maps
* Makes a great league starter
* Laugh at Reflect mods
* Multiple movement options: Phase Run, Frost Blink, Leap Slap

### Cons

* Movement speed and Damage may be too slow and low respectively for those that prefer a Zoom Zoom play style
* End-game damage falls off hard and needs considerable investment
