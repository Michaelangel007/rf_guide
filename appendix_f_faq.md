# Appendix F. FAQ

Q. **How soon can I run RF on a Templar or Maruader?**
  * Around Level 20 on a Maruader, Level 22 on a Templar.

---

Q. **What does "Sustain RF" mean?**
  * Normally when you cast RF it will drain your life down to 1 and turn off. HOWEVER if your life regen is high enough it will STAY ON! This latter state is called "Sustaining RF" where you can permantently run RF and keep our life at or near max.

**NOTE:** There are some "edge cases" where you won't be able to sustain RF.  These will be discussed below.

---

Q. **What do I need to do in order to sustain RF at charcter level 20?**
  * A few things:
    * Life Regen > 150 life/second
    * Fire Resist >= 89%
    * Regenerate 1 Life per second for each 1% Uncapped Fire Resistance

---

Q. **What is "Uncapped Fire Resistance"?**
  * Normally your fire resist is soft-capped at 75% (unless you raise your max Fire Resistance.)  Your uncapped fire resistance is the raw value greater than your capped fire ristance.

**NOTE:** PoE will only apply 75% fire resists (or your capped resistance) to spell damage reduction.

---

Q. **How does the skill** _"Regenerate 1 Life per second for each 1% Uncapped Fire Resistance"_ **work?**
  * Assuming your fire resist are soft-capped at 75% (the default) then FOR 1% you are over 75% you gain 1% Life/Second.  For example.  If you have 90% uncapped FR, then you would gain 90-75 = 15% Life Regen.

---

Q. **Are there any caveats with running the skill:** _"Regenerate 1 Life per second for each 1% Uncapped Fire Resistance"?_
  * Yes, two.
    * In Merciless difficulty you may find it hard to have > 75% fire resist so you may want to refund this skill, and
    * You can get into a situtation where you can't sustain your RF. See the next question.

---

Q. **HELP! I increased the soft cap of my fire resist and now I can't sustain RF!**
  * First, don't panic.
  * You have a passive skill that your life regen is getting a bonus from via your uncapped fire resists.  You will have to:

    * Equip more life regen items,
    * Take life regen nodes on the tree, or
    * Lower your max fire resist.

---

Q. **HELP! I got cursed and now I can't sustain RF!**
  * Mobs can curses you lowering your fire resistance and/or ignite you.  Either use ...

    * _Purity of Fire_ aura,
    * or _Purity of Elements_ aura

... so you are immune to being ignited.

---

Q. **Why do you have re-cast RF every time I enter a zone?**
  * It is a Bug/Feature.  Post a feature request on the GGG PoE forum asking a QoL enhancement so we don't have to keep doing this.

---

Q. **If I cast RF but then remove the RF gem why does the RF aura remain around my character?**
  * It is a bug if you have enough life regen. Change zones and it will disappear.

---

Q. **Does "Increased Spell Damage" apply to RF?**
  * Sadly, no.  You can test this out by equipping the unique ring [Tawhanuku's Timing
](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Tawhanuku%27s_Timing) and seeing the tooltip DPS stays the same.
