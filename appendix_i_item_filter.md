# Appendix I. Item Filter

## Appendix I.1 Item Filter Overview

PoE is an ARPG; _ALL_ ARPGs can be summarized via:

1. Virtual Genocide
2. Get phat loot
3. Rinse and repeat

Unfortunately, this means that a LOT of items drop when you kill mobs. These range from outright bad or useless items to _very_ good items for your bulid.  These Bad items provide contrast so you appreciate the Good items more.

As such PoE natively supports an in-game _Item Filter_ (or _Loot Filter_) to show/hide/customize items.  This way you can hide the items you aren't interested in.  The defacto standard loot filter is [FilterBade's Item Filter](https://www.filterblade.xyz/).

FilterBlade provides pre-made "levels" of loot filters. Soft will show more while Strict will show less.

New players should start with the _Regular_ one until they get comfortable customizing their loot filter.

## Appendid I.3 Customizing a Loot Filter

Why would I want to customize a loot filter?

* Maybe you want to show an item that is hidden by the loot filter?
* Myabe you want to hide an item that is shown by the loot filter?
* Maybe you want to change the the color of the item text?
* Maybe you want to change the border of the item text?
* Maybe you want to change the font size of the item text?
* Maybe you want to use custom sounds?

Whatever the reason PoE's Item Filter is a context-free **plain-text file** that you can edit in a text editor.  It has its own syntax.  GGG provides some [information](https://www.pathofexile.com/item-filter/about) about the item filter syntax. The Wiki provides a few guides:
