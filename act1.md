# 3 Campaign Walkthrough

## 3.1 Act 1

### 3.1.1 Zone: Twilight Strand, Monster Level 1

Zone Objectives:

 * Pick up and equip our two skill gems,
 * Reach the end of the zone in the North East,
 * Kill Hillock,
 * Reach Level 2,
 * Enter Lioneye's Watch town.

If you are experienced with PoE feel free to skip the tutorials to minimize popups.

1. Press a button to wake up,
2. Pick up your weapon,
3. Talk to the dying exile,
4. Kill them,
5. Pick up your first skill gem, and
6. Equip it in the correct colored socket (on the weapon.)

Players new to PoE will notice that their character moves _really_ slow -- almost as if moving through molasses. This is _intentional_ game design **to provide contrast** between _no_ movement speed and _some_ movement speed.  This way you appreciate 30%+ movement speed.

At the end of the zone is your first unique boss [Hillock](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Hillock)

Hillock has two phases.

* Phase 1, Life 100% to 50%. He starts unarmed.
* Phase 2, Life  50% to 0%.  At the start of the second phase he will heal up and pull out a weapon.

The trick to killing Hillock is to run around in circles doing "drive by attacks". Namely,

1. Wait for his wind-up animation.
2. Manually circle dodge via moving.
3. Attack with your "heavy hitter" that costs mana
4. Rinse-and-Repeat.

Upon killing Hillock you should receive your first passive skill point.  What you should take for your first passive point will depend if you are playing SC or HC:

* Level 2 **SC:** _Damage and Mana_ 
* Level 2 **HC:** _Mana Regeneration and Life_

In HC you need to be _extremely_ cautious since you _don't_ have life regeneration but you DO have mana regeneration so you will want to use your other "special" attack that costs mana.  

**Players new to HC** may want to level up to **level 4** before heading into town. This is because **the next few zones are some of the most dangeous ones in the game!** The main reason being we lack the life, items (armour), and skills to provide defenses.

To reach level 4:

  * Kill all mobs in the zone,
  * "Reset" the zone

Repeatedly clearing a zone will give you XP to help you to be "overleveled" -- your character level is higher than the zone's Monster Level (which can be seen in the top right). This provide you a nice safety buffer / margin of life, offsenses and defenses.

Every time your character levels up you:

 * Heal up to 100% life and mana, and
 * Have your Flasks refilled.

To manually reset the zone you need to have it "time out" after ~10 minutes. This way you can farm for gear such as:

  * Armor
    * Helmet, 
    * Body,
    * Gloves, and
    * Boots,
  * Rings,
  * Currency such wisdom scrolls or Orb of Transmutaition,
  * Flasks, and
  * Starting gems; specifically we want 2 spare red gems.

Why would you farm 2 spare red gems? Selling a `Red gem` + `Iron ring` to a vendor gives you a ruby _Fire Resistance_ ring (requires character level 16). You will need 2 of them when we switch to our main skill Righeous Fire around level 25.

A common trick to reset the _Twilight Strand_ is to switch to a different character, play/wait 10 minutes, and then switch back your character in _Twilight Strand._

The other reason you may want to reset Twilight Strand is that there is an achievement called **Beginner's Luck** for getting an unique from Hillock:

* _Have a Unique Item drop in the Twilight Strand in Act 1_

I do NOT recommend this until you have multiple characters and/or are extremely bored.

What makes this achievement a PITA to collect is that **once you leave Twilight Strand you can NOT re-enter it.**  This means you need to keep one character "parked" in Twilight Strand so you can kill Hillock over and over.  Still sane, exile?

The reason I bring this up is because you can see your [achievements here](https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/CheckList/achievements)

Head into Lioneye's Watch once you are ready.

## 3.1.2 Town: Lioneye's Watch

Town Objectives:

  * Talk to Tarkleigh, Quest: Enemy at the Gate, Hillock Reward: Rolling Magma

## 3.1.3 Zone: The Coast, Monster Level 2

Zone Objectives:
  
  * Tag the WP in the North East
  * Surive _Fire Fury_ (or even skip)
  * Exit via _The Tidal Island_

/!\ In HC you need to be _extremely_ careful here as:

 * The _Cannibal_ mobs can throw torches and ignite you.  Fortunately it is easy to just move back and dodge the single torch.  
 * There is an unique boss here, _Fire Fury,_ that casts Firestorm that can quickly kill the unprepared player. She can also teleport.  
 
The best way to be prepared for this fight is:
 
  * Keep moving and just entirely skip her (!),

Or if you really DO want to fight her:

  * Be level 4,
  * Have spare life and mana flasks,
  * Circle dodge, and
  * Face tank her.

If you get into trouble just keep kiting her back to the town entrance. There is no shame in a strategic retreat.

    He who fights and runs away
    May live to fight another day
    But he who is battle slain
    Can never rise to fight again.
      --  Oliver Goldsmith

On level up allocate the following skill points for SC:

  * Level 3 SC: _Damage and Mana_
  * Level 4 SC: _Elemental Damage_

Or for HC:

  * Level 3 HC: _Mana and Life_
  * Level 4 HC: _Mana and Life Regeneration_

## 3.1.4 Zone: The Tidal Island, Monster Level 3

Zone Objectives:

  * Kill unique mob [Hailrake](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Hailrake)
  * Pick up quest item _Medicine Chest_
  * [HC] [Optional] Kill all mobs

Careful of the _Tide Striders_ as they can chill you causing your movement speed to be slow forcing you to not be able to dodge.

If you are level 4 you should be able to face tank _Hailrake._ If not,
dodge his cold attack and use hit-and-run tactics.

To return to town _without_ using a Portal Scroll return to the character select screen.  Re-select your same character and you will be back in Lioneye's Watch.

Level up:

  * Level 4 SC: _Elemental Damage_
  * Level 5 HC: _Mana and Life Regeneration_

### 3.1.5 Zone: Lioneye's Watch

* Talk to Nessa to turn in the medicine chest, Quest: Mercy Mission, Rewards: 

 * Medium Life Flask (Level 3) (preferred) or Quicksilver Flask (Level 4).
 * Blue gem, Arcane Surge Support

### 3.1.6 Zone: The Coast, Monster Level 2

Exit via _The Mud Flats_

### 3.1.7 Zone: The Mud Flats, Monster Level 4

Zone Objectives:

  * Collect all three glyphs
  * Place the glyph in the wall
  * Exit in the North East to _The 

/!\  In HC you need to be _extremely_ careful here as:

  * The Rhoas will charge you **stunning you,**
  * This can cascade into you being "stun locked" while more rhoas charge you
