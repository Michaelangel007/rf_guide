Alternatively, if you enjoy [Delve](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Delve) you can find the following socket recipes at roughly the following _minimum_ depth:

| Depth | Biome                                                         | Crafting Recipe |

|  ~200 | [Primeval Ruins](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Primeval_Ruins) | 6 Link          |

**NOTES:**

* The _Abyssal City_ is different from the [Abyssal Depths](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Abyssal_Depths_(Delve).
* If you wish to farm the Delve bosses, [Aul, the Crystal King](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Aul,_the_Crystal_King) he can only spawn at depth 130+; realistically this will be 250+.
