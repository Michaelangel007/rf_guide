# 3 Campaign Walkthrough

## 3.3 Act 3

### 3.3.0 Skill Gems, Support Gems, Sockets, and Linking

[Act 3](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Act_3) is where 4 socket armor starts to drop. This is important because we eventually want to equip the following 4 gems together in the same item in order to boost our damage.

* (Blue) Righteous Fire
* (Blue) Elemental Focus Support
* (Blue) Efficacy Support
* (Red) Burning Damage Support

You'll notice that 3 of those gems are [support gems](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Support_gem).  Support gems by themselves do nothing; they MUST be "linked" with a [skill gem](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Skill_gem) before the support gem functions.

In order to have all 4 gems active we need an item not just with 4 sockets but ALL the sockets ALSO need:

  * to be the correct colors, and
  * all need to be linked.

We use the following currency items to modify sockets:

  * [Chromatic Orb](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Chromatic_Orb) to randomly re-color the sockets.
  * [Jeweller's Orb](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Jeweller%27s_Orb) to randomly re-roll the number of sockets an item has.
  * [Orb of Fusing](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Orb_of_Fusing) to randomly re-link sockets.

This is a 4 socket item:

     ______
    /      \
    | O  O |
    |      |
    | O  O |
    |      |
    |______|


This is a 4 socket, 2-link item:

     ______
    /      \
    | O--O |
    |      |
    | O  O |
    |      |
    |______|

As is this:

     ______
    /      \
    | O  O |
    |    | |
    | O  O |
    |      |
    |______|


And this:

     ______
    /      \
    | O  O |
    |      |
    | O--O |
    |      |
    |______|

This is a 4 socket, 3-link item:

     ______
    /      \
    | O--O |
    |    | |
    | O  O |
    |      |
    |______|

As is this variation of a 4 socket, 3-link:

     ______
    /      \
    | O  O |
    |    | |
    | O--O |
    |      |
    |______|


This is a 4 socket, 4-link item that we want:

     ______
    /      \
    | O--O |
    |    | |
    | O--O |
    |      |
    |______|

Every item has an [Item Level](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Item_level) that determines its potential properties.  Among these is the max sockets an item can have (based on its base type and item level.)  For example,

  * a Quiver can never have sockets regardless of its item level,
  * an 1-Handed weapons can never have more 3 sockets, but may have 2 or 3 sockets based on its item level,
  * a 2-Handed bow can have up to 6 sockets but the item level may restrict it to 2, 3, 4, or 5 sockets.

The minimum item level required for sockets is:

|Item Level|Sockets|
|:--------:|:-----:|
|     1    |   1   |
|     1    |   2   |
|     2    |   3   |
|    25    |   4   |
|    35    |   5   |
|    50    |   6   |

You may find the above table easier to based on Sockets:

|Sockets|Item Level|
|:-----:|:--------:|
|   1   |     1    |
|   2   |     1    |
|   3   |     2    |
|   4   |    25    |
|   5   |    35    |
|   6   |    50    |

While the cursor is over an item hold down the following button to see the item level:

  * On desktop hold down `Alt`,
  * On console hold down `L3`.
