# 3. Campaign Walkthrough

This is a complete Campaign walkthrough zone-by-zone meant for players who have never played PoE before thus it is extremely verbose.  PoE is _heavily_ dependent on knowledge and there is no substitue for experience to give you this. Take your time, explore the zones, learn the game, and you will be rewarded.

## 3.0 Zone Layouts

The following short-hand will be used to indicate zone layouts:

* `#` Maze
* `O` Circular
* `8` Multiple smaller loops
* `-` Linear
* `â–³` Pryamid -- multiple floors with each floor getting smaller and smaller.
* `Z` Linear but seperated by doors/tunnels. i.e. [Malformation Map]()
